### Compilation Errors

:::danger[Build Error: Code 9009]
`Command ... BetterLyrics.DevTools.exe exited with code 9009`
:::

**Cause**: The build script cannot find the `DevTools` executable.

**Solution**:
1. Check if the `<AnalyzerPath>` path in your `.csproj` is correct.
2. Ensure you have compiled the `BetterLyrics.DevTools` project at least once.

### Runtime Errors

:::danger[FileNotFoundException]
`FileNotFoundException: BetterLyrics.Core`
:::

**Cause**: You tried to run the plugin DLL manually, or `Smart Trim` failed.

**Solution**:
1. This is **expected behavior**. The plugin *should not* include `BetterLyrics.Core.dll` because the host application provides it.
2. Please test by loading the plugin through the Host Application.

<br />

:::danger[TypeLoadException]
`TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'PluginConfigBase'`
:::

**Cause**: The version of `BetterLyrics.Core` running in the host application is older than the version used when compiling the plugin.

**Solution**:
1. **Recompile the host application** (`BetterLyrics.WinUI3`) to ensure it includes the latest Core.
2. Check if a conflicting copy of `BetterLyrics.Core.dll` exists in the `LocalState/plugins` folder.

### Warning Messages

:::caution[System library missing]
System library missing warning appears after publishing
:::

**Cause**: The Native AOT Trimmer stripped away system classes you are using via reflection.

**Solution**:
1. Check the Host's `PluginConfigs` folder. Does `MyPlugin_TrimmerRoots.xml` exist?
2. If it exists, recompile the Host. This configuration file acts as a whitelist for the Trimmer.
